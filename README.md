Using web scraping and tokenization of Yelp reviews from a sample of different Korean Barbecue restaurants in Los Angeles County, we will look for keywords for restaurants both individually and as a collective. Each restaurant will have a sample of their reviews vectorized. Recurring words from other vectorized samples of other restaurants will then be removed, leaving us with our keywords. The vectors for each restaurant will then be compared with the overall rating of the restaurant and the number of keywords taken into account. Words used to describe the atmosphere, price, and quality will make up most of our text processing. These keywords will allow us to distinguish the quality of the different Korean Barbeque restaurants and show what components make up a good or bad Korean barbecue restaurant.
